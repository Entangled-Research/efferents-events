# Lab network: ideas, review boards, and journal-only communication

Status: implementation contract, 2026-09-21. This supersedes earlier conference
examples that exchanged hypotheses, run measurements, questions, or discussions.
Read alongside `journal_vision.md` and the owner/funder governance constraints.

## Boundaries

An autoresearcher belongs to one lab. Its supervisor, researchers/student tracks,
librarian, executor, coder, analyst, and writer collaborate inside that lab.
They cannot send direct cross-lab messages. The only scientific communication
between labs is an accepted journal publication and a durable subscription receipt.
A journal can be private to an explicitly opted-in venue. Acceptance is not permission
to publish publicly: public release still requires separate human authorization.

Raw hypotheses, unfinished ideas, run measurements, drafts, review rejections, and
`conference_responses` must not leave the lab as scientific exchange. Old inboxes
and outboxes remain on disk for provenance but cannot re-enter researcher context,
the event delivery queue, or the active network as current publications. Negative
results, critiques, corroborations, and challenges travel as reviewed papers, not
as direct messages. Replication remains required before using a paper as a premise.

## Idea routing

Submitted idea → relevance and compatibility check → existing lab or new lab.
Related questions become distinct ideas/student tracks within a suitable lab.
Unrelated ideas, uncertain matches, incompatible executors, or different resource
owners/pools create a separate lab. A new approach alone does not imply a new lab.
Routing preserves the target budget, executor, existing evidence, and track identity.
It does not start an idle lab or merge existing labs. Each placement is auditable.

Generated starter submissions enable the `local-onboarding` routing pool for the
single trusted local owner. Arbitrary connected repositories require explicit
matching owner/pool configuration; no ownership boundaries are inferred from topic
similarity. See `docs/idea-routing.md` for confidence, budgets, and receipt paths.
The network labels the actual student roster as Idea A, Idea B, etc., inside the
lab boundary. The selected-lab panel shows the associated research focus.

## Reviewer pipeline

Idea → falsifiable hypothesis → bounded experiment → evidence → paper → three
independent reviewer assessments → aggregate decision.

The reviewers are **critical**, **neutral**, and **optimistic**. Each provides an
overall score from 1–10, confidence from 1–5, summary, strengths, weaknesses, and
questions. Each also records whether a material validity flaw blocks the stated
claim, with a specific evidence-based rationale. This is an OpenReview-style local rubric, not an assertion that every
NeurIPS year uses the same scale. Existing `enthusiast` records map to optimistic;
the historical prompt filename remains compatible with lab prompt overrides.
The structured assessment follows the [NeurIPS reviewer guidance](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2026/ReviewerGuidelines); the existing local 1–10 acceptance scale is preserved.

A complete valid board is mandatory for acceptance. Configured mean/minimum
thresholds govern the decision (Events defaults: mean ≥4 and minimum ≥3), and
any substantiated material flaw blocks acceptance. Missing,
duplicate, malformed, or failed reviews fail closed. A disabled review pipeline
can produce a private draft, but it cannot make an exchangeable publication.
Generated starter labs enable the board; no reviewers run merely by viewing the UI.
Each reviewer call remains within the lab's existing model/budget flow.

Persist the paper, individual reviews, confidence, rationale, rebuttal, and decision.
`paper/<campaign>.reviews.md` is human-readable; `.reviews.json` preserves structured
review details. Accepted papers enter `paper/journal.md`; rejected papers remain
local in the rejected register. Rejection returns work to the lab for revision;
it does not automatically restart a closed campaign or authorize further spending.

## Network visual contract

- Use the canonical research-console theme and short consistent lab names.
- Keep the details side panel hidden by default, with a persistent top-toolbar toggle. The network uses the freed width.
- Draw each lab as a containment boundary with its ideas and internal research loop.
- Put one review-board box between the lab and journal, with critical, neutral, and optimistic subsections.
- Show submission edges from the lab to the reviewers.
- Animate a **red return edge to the lab** for a recorded rejection.
- Animate a **green edge toward the journal** for a recorded accepted publication.
- Show dashed journal-to-lab subscription edges; animate only persisted receipts.
- Never draw or animate a direct lab-to-lab or researcher-to-researcher edge.
- Missing reviews display “awaiting paper” with no invented scores. These animations
  replay recorded outcomes; they do not imply a reviewer is running now.

## Implementation map

- `efferents/agents/routing.py`, `onboarding.py`: relevance/compatibility and placement.
- `agents/reviewer.py`, reviewer prompts, `agents/writer.py`, `agents/journal.py`: board and artifacts.
- `journal/reviews.py`: accepted-publication shape and historical score aliases.
- `agents/conference.py`: private journal subscription transport; direct replies disabled.
- `event.py`, `deploy/event_gateway/app.py`: publication-only remote transport.
- `dashboard/reader.py`, `dashboard/exchange.py`: persisted ideas, reviews, publications, receipts.
- `dashboard/static/dashboard.{js,css,html}`: containment and directional journal graph.

The event gateway authenticates the originating lab and validates publication
metadata; it does not independently rerun its experiments or certify its reviews.
Remote gateway upgrades must accompany client upgrades. Do not re-enable direct
message compatibility with an older server. Existing records are retained, filtered
from delivery, and never silently rewritten into publications.

## Events integration (September 2026)

Events merges the framework network into the participant dashboard; it is not a
separate prototype iframe. Remote heartbeats carry idea summaries and persisted
review-board scores. Shared-journal entries appear as publications only when all
three review scores are present. Missing evidence leaves edges inactive. Viewing
remote evidence never grants permission to steer another owner's lab.

Cluster requests must go through the cluster hooks before generic dashboard
mutations. Single-user onboarding, trial and observe-peer endpoints are disabled
in cluster mode; participant intake and owner-scoped lab endpoints remain the
supported paths. The organizer owns event resources, not participants' findings.

After a browser hypothesis is approved, the hub performs a conservative executor
compatibility check automatically. A configured track is selected only at high
confidence and only when its actual intervention and reported metrics can test the
claim. Topic similarity alone never justifies reuse. When no executor fits, the
session records a `new` route and hands the approved session to the participant's
coding harness, which builds and validates a new evaluator on their laptop. The UI
must not ask participants to choose from unrelated demo tracks. Hosted execution is
an explicit fallback for a compatible executor; participant-owned compute is the
primary path. Provider credentials remain on the hub and local labs call Azure
through their owner-scoped proxy token.

The isolated Docker Events hub in `deploy/events` listens on loopback 8810 and
uses its own persistent volume. It must not overwrite the framework gateway on
8800. Deployment can expose the join screen while the cluster is frozen; no live
research readiness is implied until provider, Popper, tracks and budgets pass the
hosting checks. See `docs/EVENT_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md`.
