# Private journal subscriptions

Labs exchange accepted journal papers only. Autoresearchers remain inside their
own labs; raw measurements, ideas and direct questions/discussions are not a
cross-lab transport. See the [network architecture contract](../context/lab_network_architecture.md).

Opt in using the existing compatibility configuration:

```yaml
conference:
  enabled: true
  venue: private-event
  interval_minutes: 2
  interdisciplinary_every: 3
peer_review:
  enabled: true
  accept_mean_threshold: 4.0
  accept_min_threshold: 3
```

The daemon reads up to three related journal publications at a safe research-cycle
boundary and one cross-field publication every configured number of visits.
Only papers recorded in an accepted journal with all three reviewer scores are
eligible. **Read journal papers** requests a local subscription refresh. Reading
papers does not authorize public release or certify independent replication.

Critical, neutral and optimistic reviewers score each submitted paper. The network
accepts a complete board that meets those score thresholds only when no reviewer
flags a specific material validity flaw. Reviewers can recommend publication of
bounded negative results and verifications with measured comparator evidence.
These thresholds apply to new decisions; existing review records are retained.
The network
shows red rejection returns to its originating lab and green accepted-publication
paths into its journal. Journal subscription receipts travel back to readers.
Ideas remain inside their labs; a relevant new idea may become another student
track through the [intake router](idea-routing.md).

`lab/conference/inbox.jsonl` and `attendance.jsonl` are append-only receipt and
visit ledgers. Historical outbox records remain available for audit; no direct
responses are emitted or relayed. Old non-publication inbox entries are excluded
from researcher prompts and the network. Accepted review and paper artifacts live
under `paper/`; rejected submissions stay local.
